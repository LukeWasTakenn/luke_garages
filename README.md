FiveM mod that adds garages and impounds for the ESX framework

This resource adds vehicle garages for cars (including trucks and stuff), boats and aircrafts.<br>
You can configure the location of each garage, return circle and spawn coordinates in the config file.<br>
The resource is using WarMenu made by Warxander.<br>
In the config you can choose whether you want the damage on the vehicles to be saved, fuel will always save not depending on what you choose.<br>
Depending on the damage on the car when you it's stored, when you take it out the script will do damage to it to make it look visually damaged.<br>
The impound checks whether the vehicle is already in the world to prevent vehicle duping.<br>
If you want you can have all the vehicles be stored in the garage automatically on resource (or server) restart (check server.lua for this).<br>
